Here's a general outline of the workflow based on different roles:

1. **Guest (Unauthenticated User)**
   - Can access public pages like the login and registration pages.
   - Can register for a new account.
   - Can log in with valid credentials.

2. **User**
   - Upon successful login, the user is authenticated and receives an access token.
   - Can view their own tasks.
   - Can create new tasks assigned to themselves.
   - Can update and delete their own tasks.
   - Cannot access or modify tasks of other users.

3. **Admin**
   - In addition to the capabilities of regular users, admins have additional privileges.
   - Can view all tasks of all users.
   - Can create new tasks assigned to any user.
   - Can update and delete any task.
   - May have access to an admin dashboard with advanced features, such as filtering, sorting, and searching tasks.

4. **Authorization and Authentication**
   - Requests to protected routes require a valid access token.
   - Access tokens are typically sent in the request headers (e.g., Authorization header).
   - Middleware functions are used to verify the access token and extract the user's role and information from it.
   - Unauthorized or invalid access attempts are handled with appropriate error responses.

5. **Routing and Middleware**
   - Routes are defined and organized based on functionality (e.g., user routes, admin routes, task routes).
   - Middleware functions are applied to protect routes based on user roles.
   - Middleware functions validate the user's role and permissions before allowing access to specific routes.

The above workflow is a general outline and can be customized based on your specific application requirements. It's important to design and implement the workflow with security and usability in mind, ensuring that each user role has the appropriate level of access and functionality.
